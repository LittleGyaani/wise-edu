Completely destroyed during the Mongol invasion in 1240, the city lost most of its influence for the centuries to come. It was a provincial capital of marginal importance in the outskirts of the territories controlled by its powerful neighbours; first the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, followed by Poland and Russia.</p>\r\n<p>The city prospered once again during the Russian Empire’s Industrial Revolution in the late 19th century. In 1917, after the Ukrainian National Republic declared independence from the Russian Empire, Kyiv became its capital. From 1919, Kyiv was an important centre of the Armed Forces of South Russia and was controlled by the White Army. From 1921 onwards, Kyiv was a city of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, which was proclaimed by the Red Army, and, from 1934, Kyiv was its capital. During World War II, the city again suffered significant damage, but quickly recovered in the post-war years, remaining the third-largest city of the Soviet Union.</p>', '<p>The degree awarded by&nbsp;<strong>Kyiv Medical University</strong>&nbsp;is MD (Physician) which is equivalent to MBBS in India.
